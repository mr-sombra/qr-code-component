## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS3
* Flexbox
* Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm not a designer but I tried my best to follow the original design, I still learning web design, I used CSS nesting so it is easier to read the code. For example:

```css
.card {
  ...

  & .code {
    ...
  }

  & .title {
    ...
  }

  & .description {
    ...
  }
}
```

I optimized all the images, so PNG or JPG now are WEBP. This reduces the weight of the images, also the quality but it pretty much look the same.
